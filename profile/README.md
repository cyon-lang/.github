# The Cyon Programing Language
A powerful and efficient system programming language with a straightforward syntax and an effective package manager.

## Why?

This project, Cyon, was born out of my admiration for C++. However, at the same time, I found some of its limitations to be limiting.

One of these limitations is the inclusion of C support and C standard library, which I believe can lead to a mixture of the two languages. Another limitation is the unreadability of some compiler errors, which can make it difficult to troubleshoot and fix code. Additionally, there is a lack of a good package manager for C++.

With Cyon, my goal is to address these issues and improve upon them. I want to create a programming language that is more efficient, readable and easy to work with. After all, who hasn't ever dreamt of creating their own programming language ;D

## Syntax
```rust
import std.iolib;

fn main :i32()
{
    let test :i32 = 1337;
    std::println("Hello world! {}", test);
    return 0;
}

```
